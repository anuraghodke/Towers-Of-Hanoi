**Towers Of Hanoi**

Towers of Hanoi is a classic recursive logic puzzle where the objective is to move an entire stack of disks from one peg to another. 

Rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time

2. You can only move the top disk of any stack

3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller one

The goal is to recreate the same stack of disks on a new peg, using as few moves as possible.
